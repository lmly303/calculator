# Simple Calculator Program in Python

This Python script implements a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations on two numbers. It prompts the user to enter two numbers and select an operation (+, -, *, /) to perform on them.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:


5. Follow the on-screen instructions:
- Enter the first number when prompted.
- Enter the second number when prompted.
- Enter the operation you want to perform (+, -, *, /) when prompted.

6. The script will output the result of the operation.

## Example

Suppose you want to perform addition of two numbers:

Welcome to my calculator

Enter the first number : 10

Enter the second number : 5

Enter the operation you want to perform (+,-,*,/) : +

Result: 15



In this example, the user inputs `10` as the first number, `5` as the second number, and `+` as the operation to perform. The script then outputs the result, which is `15`, as expected.

## Note

- Division by zero will result in an error message.
